    <h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
    <p>The main idea for this lab is to write functions that take user input and manipulate a string</p>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>This lab was harder than any of the other labs. Although, the example from the instructions really helped.
    Also, when I was done with this lab, I could not get it to upload on to github. After a few tries I finally
    was able to see it on my browser.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Here is the program execution:</p>

    <div id = "output">
	 		<h3>Script Output</h3>
	    <script src="js/lab7.js"></script>
	  </div>

    <a href = "js/lab7.js">JavaScript Source</a>
