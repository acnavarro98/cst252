// Create a "FizzBuzz" function similar to how we did in class.
  function fizzBuzz (maxNums, factorObj) {

  // Loop through numbers 1 to 200, listing them as you go
    for (var num=0; num < maxNums; num++) {
      
    }
// If the number is a multiple of 3, if should print "Fizz!"

// If the number is a multiple of 5, it should print "Buzz!"

// If the number is a multiple of 7, it should print "Boom!"

// If the number is a multiple of more than one 3, 5 or 7, it should combine Fizz, Buzz, and Boom. For example, if the number is a multiple of 3 AND 5, it should print "FizzBuzz!" and so on.

// Make it so the output of your program appears in your output div.
  // One way to do this is to compile one long string as you output numbers. Something like: str += num + " Fizz!<br>"; Then output the str at the end to your div using innerHTML.
  // Another way: For each number, create a new DOM element, change the innerHTML to the text you want, and appendChild() to the end of your output div.
//Don't forget to call your function.
